      '“I do not ask for your love; to love you is enough. I carry this feeling not as a burden, but as a quiet joy, a sacred flame that needs no answer. Let me suffer if I must—but allow me the dignity of loving you in silence forever.”',
    author: 'Dostoevsky',
  },
  {
    quote:
      '“To be alone is nothing, but to be misunderstood while among others—ah, that is the true exile. You speak, and your words pass through them like wind. Their eyes are open, but they do not see. In such moments, silence becomes your last and only faithful companion.”',
    author: 'Dostoevsky',
  },
  {
    quote:
      '“I believe the heart remembers what the mind seeks to forget. Years may pass, faces may fade, but one glance, one dream, and the wound bleeds anew. And strangely, it is a sweet pain, as if the soul delights in its own ruin, in its eternal longing.”',
    author: 'Dostoevsky',
  },
  {
    quote:
      '“Sometimes I think that to feel too deeply is a curse, not a gift. The world does not ask for depth—it wants cheerfulness, simplicity, obedience. But the heart rebels. It wants to know, to suffer, to burn. And so it burns—quietly, endlessly, without anyone ever knowing.”',
    author: 'Dostoevsky',

  {
    quote:
      '“Freedom is not in choosing between tea or coffee, nor in voting once every four years. True freedom is being able to look into the abyss of your soul and not flinch. It is standing naked before your own conscience and saying: ‘Yes, this is who I am.’”',
    author: 'Dostoevsky',
  },
  {
    quote:
      '“They say love is joy, but they forget how often it walks with despair. To love is to be vulnerable to everything—the gaze, the silence, the turning away. And still, we love. Not because it saves us, but because in that pain, we find a strange kind of salvation.”',
    author: 'Dostoevsky',
  },
  {
    quote:
      '“Man is a creature who can get used to anything, and that is both his triumph and his tragedy. Put him in a cage, he’ll decorate it. Give him chains, he’ll polish them. We adapt, yes—but in doing so, how much of our soul do we lose?”',
    author: 'Dostoevsky',
  },
  {
    quote:
      '“I have seen kind men do cruel things, and cruel men weep like children. There are no pure souls, no demons walking on two legs. We are all tangled—light and dark, pride and guilt. And if you look closely enough, you will find yourself in even your enemy’s face.”',
    author: 'Dostoevsky',
  },
  {
    quote:
      '“There is a suffering that asks for no witness, that hides itself behind smiles and conversations. It sits quietly inside the ribs, watching the world go on. And when the door is shut and the lights go out, it stretches out, finally alone, finally free to ache.”',
    author: 'Dostoevsky',
  },
  {
    quote:
      '“To be loved for who you pretend to be is worse than being unloved altogether. For every smile given to the mask is a wound to the soul beneath it. And in time, you forget which is the real you—the one smiling, or the one screaming behind the smile.”',
